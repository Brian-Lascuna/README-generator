# Professional README Generator

## Description
A script to generate a professional README based on the user's input. This project utilizes several concepts learned throughout the week involving node.js such as node modules, module exports and imports, as well as reading and writing files. This project was built not only to generate proper READMEs with ease but to also practice and apply what I learned about node.js.

## Installation
This script uses the 'inquirer' module and can be installed via the node package manager by using the 'npm install' or 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' commands.

## Usage
After installing inquirer, simply run the script using 'node index.js' and answer the following prompts. Once finished, a README will be generated in the same directory as the script location.

A video demonstration can be viewed [here]().
